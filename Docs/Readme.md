# Weather Rock

As simple as the name, I was scrolling through the web for something cool, fun, and creative to build when I came across a Reddit post talking about app ideas. One of them was a weather app that uses a rock.

Basically, depending on the weather, the rock would change. I thought that was hilariously simple at the same time, so I thought to myself, 'Why not build an app that does this, then put it on the web, iOS, and Android?'

Here we areâ€”Weather Rock.
