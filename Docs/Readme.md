# Weather Rock

As smiple as the name, I was srocilling through the web for a somtheing cool,fun and creative to build and I came along a reddit post takig about app ideas one of them was the  a weather app that  use a rock.

Baiscly, deaping on the weater  the rock would change, i thught that was hillurlsy but also simple at the same time, so i thought to my self why not build app that does this, then put up on the web, ios and andriod..

Here we are, weather rock.
