# Weather Rock

As simple as the name, I was scrolling through the web for something cool, fun, and creative to build when I came across a Reddit post talking about app ideas. One of them was a weather app that uses a rock.

Basically, depending on the weather, the rock would change. I thought that was hilariously simple at the same time, so I thought to myself, 'Why not build an app that does this, then put it on the web, iOS, and Android?'

Here we are—Weather Rock.

## What is Weather Rock ?

It's a rock that tells the weather, pretty simple.

## What type of rock is it?

As of this moment the rock yea is just a reguler rock.

## How would the rock change appearance to show the weather?

 The rock’s appearance will change depending on the weather:
        Wet (rain)
        White (snow)
        Sideways (wind)
        Gone (hurricane)
        Dry & Bright (sunny)
        Wet & Bright (sun showers)
        Dry & Dark (overcast)

## How reliable is the Weather Rock in predicting the weather?

Quite relible since it will be using a weather api.
